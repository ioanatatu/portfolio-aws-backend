# This repo contains the backend code for the portfolio project.

### I am using the **AWS** services and the **serverless framework** to create a **RESTful API** which provides data for my client.

#

### `lambda functions` &#8212; `api gateway` &#8212; `cloud watch` &#8212; `yaml` are a few of the things I learnt while developing this project

&nbsp;

### I also employed Postman extensively for making requests to endpoints when testing.

#

## AWS resources included so far

-   S3 for image storage
-   DynamoDB for data storage
